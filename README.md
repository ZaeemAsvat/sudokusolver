# Sudoku Solver

A system that can solve any board very efficiently. The techniques used were a combination of personal techniques picked up when solving Sudoku boards by hand and the Depth-First Search Algorithm.

Feel free to clone/download and test this system. The program that needs to be run is the SudokuRun.java file. After running that file, a GUI window should open which can be used to enter values into the board. Once the initial board confguration is complete, simply click on the "solve" button and the system will solve the baord and report its solving time.

No external packages and/or frameworks required.
